        "question": "1. What is your approach to debugging JavaScript code, and can you give an example of a particularly challenging bug you've encountered and how you resolved it?",
        "answer": "My approach to debugging JavaScript starts with using console.log() for quick checks, then moving to browser dev tools (breakpoints, network tab) to trace issues step by step. I also isolate the problem by simplifying the code into smaller pieces.\n\nFor example, once I faced a bug where an API response was showing undefined. After checking the network tab, I realized the response was asynchronous, but I was trying to access the data before the promise resolved. I fixed it by using async/await to properly wait for the data.\n\n👉 Clear logging + dev tools + breaking code into smaller parts = my debugging strategy."
      },
      {
        "question": "2. How do you optimize the performance of a webpage, considering factors such as image compression, minification, and caching, and what tools do you use to measure performance?",
        "answer": "I optimize webpage performance by compressing images (WebP/AVIF formats), minifying CSS/JS/HTML, and enabling browser caching & CDN delivery for faster load times. I also use lazy loading for images and code-splitting to reduce initial payload.\n\nFor measuring, I rely on Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools), PageSpeed Insights, and GTmetrix to analyze load speed, Core Web Vitals, and get improvement suggestions.\n\n👉 In short: reduce file size, minimize requests, leverage caching/CDN, and validate with performance tools."
      },
      {
        "question": "3. Can you explain the difference between var, let, and const in JavaScript, and provide a scenario where you would use each, considering best practices for variable declaration and scope?",
        "answer": "In JavaScript:\n\nvar → Function-scoped, can be redeclared, hoisted. Rarely used now because it can cause bugs.\nUse case: When working with very old codebases that already use var.\n\nlet → Block-scoped, can be reassigned but not redeclared in the same scope.\nUse case: When a variable’s value needs to change, e.g., in a loop counter.\n\nconst → Block-scoped, cannot be reassigned (but objects/arrays can be mutated).\nUse case: For constants or variables that should not be reassigned, e.g., API keys, config values.\n\n👉 Best practice: Use const by default, switch to let if reassignment is required, and avoid var unless maintaining legacy code."
      },
      {
        "question": "4. How do you handle responsive design and ensure that your frontend applications are accessible on various devices and screen sizes, and what CSS techniques do you use to achieve this?",
        "answer": "ChatGPT said:\n\nI handle responsive design by following a mobile-first approach and using flexbox, CSS grid, and media queries to adapt layouts across devices. I also use relative units (em, %, rem, vh/vw) instead of fixed pixels for better scaling.\n\nFor accessibility, I ensure proper semantic HTML, alt text, color contrast, and keyboard navigation.\n\n👉 Example techniques:\n\nMedia queries for breakpoints (@media (max-width: 768px) { ... }).\n\nFlexbox/Grid for fluid layouts.\n\nResponsive images with srcset and picture.\n\nCSS clamp() for fluid font sizing.\n\nThis ensures the UI is scalable, accessible, and user-friendly across all screen sizes."

        "answer": "HTML Techniques:\nMinimize DOM Depth and Complexity: Flatten the HTML structure by reducing unnecessary nested elements. Utilize modern CSS layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid to achieve complex layouts without excessive wrapper divs.\nLazy Loading: Implement lazy loading for images, videos, and other heavy assets that are not immediately visible in the viewport. This reduces the initial DOM size and improves perceived loading speed.\nRemove Redundant Elements: Regularly audit the HTML for any unused or redundant elements, especially those generated by CMS or templating engines.\nCSS Techniques:\nEfficient Selectors: Use simple and efficient CSS selectors to minimize the browser's rendering time. Avoid overly complex or deeply nested selectors.\nCritical CSS: Extract and inline critical CSS required for the \"above-the-fold\" content to ensure a faster first paint. Defer the loading of non-critical CSS.\nCSS Minification and Compression: Minify CSS files to remove unnecessary characters and compress them using Gzip or Brotli for smaller file sizes.\nAvoid @import: Use <link> tags for stylesheets instead of @import within CSS, as @import can block parallel downloads.\nJavaScript Techniques:\nVirtualization/Windowing: For lists or tables with a large number of rows, implement virtualization or windowing techniques. This involves rendering only the visible portion of the list in the DOM, dynamically adding and removing elements as the user scrolls.\nDebouncing and Throttling: Apply debouncing and throttling to event handlers (e.g., scroll, resize, input) to limit the frequency of DOM manipulations or expensive calculations.\nEfficient DOM Manipulation: Batch DOM updates and avoid \"layout thrashing\" by reading and writing to the DOM in separate phases. Use requestAnimationFrame for animations.\nCode Splitting and Tree Shaking: Use tools like Webpack to implement code splitting, loading only the necessary JavaScript modules, and tree shaking to eliminate unused code.\nAsynchronous Loading: Use async or defer attributes for <script> tags to prevent JavaScript from blocking HTML parsing.\nTools:\nLighthouse (Chrome DevTools): For auditing performance, accessibility, and SEO, including identifying excessive DOM size.\nWebpack/Rollup: For bundling, minification, code splitting, and tree shaking JavaScript and CSS.\nLazy Load Libraries: Such as Intersection Observer API or dedicated libraries for image and video lazy loading.\nExample Project Application:\nIn a previous project involving a large e-commerce platform with extensive product listings, similar techniques were applied. We implemented virtualized product grids, rendering only the visible products within the user's viewport, which significantly reduced the initial DOM size and improved scroll performance. Critical CSS was extracted and inlined for faster above-the-fold rendering, and image lazy loading was implemented for product images. JavaScript event handlers for filters and sorting were debounced to prevent excessive DOM updates during user interaction. These optimizations led to a noticeable improvement in page load times and overall user experience."
